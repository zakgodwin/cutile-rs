//! CUDA stream management (RAII, host callbacks, fork/join).
//!
//! A [`CudaStream`] wraps a `CUstream` handle and ties its lifetime to its
//! parent [`CudaContext`]. Streams are created via
//! [`CudaContext::new_stream`] or [`CudaStream::fork`] and destroyed
//! automatically on [`Drop`].
//!
//! # Ordering model
//!
//! Operations enqueued on the same stream execute in FIFO order. Operations on
//! different streams may overlap. Use [`fork`](CudaStream::fork) /
//! [`join`](CudaStream::join) or explicit events ([`record_event`](CudaStream::record_event),
//! [`wait`](CudaStream::wait)) to establish cross-stream ordering.
//!
//! # Host callbacks
//!
//! [`launch_host_function`](CudaStream::launch_host_function) enqueues a
//! host-side closure that the driver invokes after all preceding stream work
//! completes. This is the primary bridge between CUDA stream completion and
//! Rust `async` futures.
