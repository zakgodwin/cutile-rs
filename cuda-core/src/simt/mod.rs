//! The cuda-oxide host surface.
//!
//! Everything under this module is the cuda-oxide host API, brought over
//! as-is for the shared host-crate migration rather than reconciled:
//! [`CudaContext`] lands next to this crate's own `Device`, and
//! [`LaunchConfig`] next to this crate's own `LaunchConfig`. The two surfaces
//! get reconciled after the repository migration, with both models in one
//! tree, and this module is deletable as a unit once that happens.
//!
//! Naming: everything cuda-oxide exposed at its crate root is re-exported
//! here, so `cuda_core::simt::X` is oxide's `cuda_core::X`. The crate root
//! additionally re-exports every name that does not collide with the
//! existing surface; the one collision is [`LaunchConfig`], which is
//! reachable only through this module.
//!
//! Differences from the cuda-oxide original, recorded for the
//! reconciliation:
//!
//! - `DeviceCopy` for the unstable `f16` primitive sits behind the
//!   default-off `f16` cargo feature, since it is nightly-only; the
//!   `half::f16` and `half::bf16` impls are always present.
//! - `#[derive(DeviceCopy)]` comes from the sibling `cuda-core-derive`
//!   crate, extracted from cuda-oxide's `cuda-macros` so it is publishable.
//! - `vmm` and `peer` are copied like the rest; #202 remains the idiomatic
//!   port of the VMM wrappers onto this crate's own runtime types.
//! - `init` and `launch_kernel` are not copied: the crate root already
//!   exposes identical ones, re-exported below.
//! - `oxide-artifacts` comes from crates.io (cuda-oxide publishes it) and is
//!   re-exported as [`artifacts`].
