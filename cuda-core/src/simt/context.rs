//! CUDA context management (primary context, RAII).
//!
//! [`CudaContext`] retains the **primary context** for a given device ordinal
//! via `cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain` and releases it on [`Drop`]. The primary
//! context is shared across the process; multiple `CudaContext` instances for
//! the same device share the same underlying `CUcontext`.
//!
//! # Thread binding
//!
//! CUDA driver calls are context-scoped and thread-local. [`CudaContext`]
//! transparently calls `cuCtxSetCurrent` before any driver operation, so
//! callers do not need to manage the context stack manually.
